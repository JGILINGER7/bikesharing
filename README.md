# Bikesharing Analysis
    The goal of this analysis is to research the viability of a bikesharing program for Des Moines and what ridership and infrastructure needs would look like. To that end we looked at the data for the Citibike program in New York to see who was riding and how often. This information was then used to create a set of visualizations in Tableau that allow us to better communicate what the use statistics look like.

## Results
### Checkout Times 
![Visualization 1 ](resources/NYC%20CitiBike%20Challenge1.png)
As seen here most trips are short with the majority falling in the under 15 minute range and trips longer than 1 hour being functionally zero. This means that the bike racks should be placed with this use pattern in mind. 

### Checkout Times by Gender
![Visualization 2](resources/NYC%20CitiBike%20Challenge2.png)
We see that by gender the checkout times do not change significantly. The main difference is the ammount of rides taken with men comprising the vast majority of rides. This data lets us understand two important things about our program firstly that we will be catering to a primarily male ridership and might have to make inventory and location adjustments to that end but secondly that female ridership needs to be better tapped and their concerns and use needs looked into. 

### Trips by Weekday
![Visualization 3 ](resources/NYC%20CitiBike%20Challenge3.png)
This visualization shows a trend of heavier riding during prime commuting hours on weekdays while ridership is heavier later morning through early afternoon on weekends. This means that inventory should be moved around to accomodate this, for example moving more bikes into residential areas from 6am to 9am to accomodate work commuters. 

### Trips by Weekday by Gender

In this data we see that gender base ridership patterns track with the gendered difference being most stark during the commute to and from work. 

### Use Trips by Gender by Weekday
![Visualization 5](resources/NYC%20CitiBike%20Challenge5.png)
Although customers are more likely to be of any gender their use is fairly even across the board with slight overrepresentation on weekends. While subscribers are heavily male and showing the highest use during the workweek. This tells us that customers who do not subscribe are more likely to be leisure riders than commuters.

### Customers

This graph further breaks down the difference in ridership showing over 3/4 of all rides are taken by subscribers. 

### August Peak Hours

Finally we take a look at a graph that shows the August peak hours. August being a dry warm month is prime time for ridership. What we see is that ridership starts to go up around 6AM peaking during the 6-7PM evening commute and then dropping to its low point in the early morning hours. This means that infrastructure and repair work is best done between the hours of 1Am and 5AM.
